<p><strong>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside")</strong> is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, <em>used to organize longer prose.</em></p>
